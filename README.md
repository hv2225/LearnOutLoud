✨ Learn Out Loud ✨is a library service with a read out loud feature which allows users to pick a text-based article/story from the main library and to add their own to their bookshelf. This library is aimed for students with difficulty in learning, such as students with ADHD, to focus more while learning. This collaborative project is one of the projects I have done for my programming course at Teachers College, Columbia University.
